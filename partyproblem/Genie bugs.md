# Genie bugs

- Does copy from the text is a Text object work?
+ How do I invoke the right-click menu when running Genie under wine?  The option-click or command-click conventions don't seem to work. Use system settings  
- The "umbrella.xdsl" file is similar to the problem I want to solve.  It gives me an error when I open the umbrella node -- "Identifier not unique" I've looked at the xdsl file and don't see where the error arises.  

-----------
# Single click select

Network tree. To select a network window, single click on the name. 

# Change arc format from icon bar doesn't work

1) Select one or more arcs
2) Choose line width icon to change width

Arcs are not re-formatted.

Use this instead of the arc properties modal dialog.
