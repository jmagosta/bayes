# Repetition: _Iterative_ statements

Repetition is central to program execution; The computer is valuable because it can repeat simple tasks with slight variations very very fast. Repetition is called _iteration_.  The basic way is to use `for` statement to repeat other statements, for a fixed number of passes, such as assignment and print statements. Such a collection of statements is called a _loop_, hence iteration is often referred to as "looping over" the statements. A "for loop" also generates a "loop variable" that counts the pass.  An example to illustrate is this for loop that calculates square roots from 0 to 9:

    for n in range(10):
        print(f'The square root of {n} is'
        print(f'\t{math.sqrt(n).'})

This syntax introduces several new concepts. 

Because of it's importance, there are numerous ways to do iteration. 


# Recap - Now we have everything necessary for program control `

We've introduced these 5 statements:

 -`=` variable assignment
 -`print()` output
 - `for` fixed count looping
 - `if` conditional execution
 - `def` function definition

 With the addition of a way to input data that's everything we need to define program execution.
