\section*{One dimensional line search via estimation}
 
 A robust optimization technique that assumes the function to be optimized 
 is unimodal, continuous but not differentiable, and noisy. The function is approximated 
 by a parabola over the set of points that have been computed, assuming that the 
 function is convex withn the range of points

This adaptive stochastic optimization is in concept similar to \emph{Response Surface Methodology} (RSM) techniques first suggested by \cite{?}. RSM was implemented as a batch function approximation method, fitting a model e.g. a low order high degree polynomial to a sampled set of points. Our function approximation approach uses an adaptive sampling method instead, applied to search in one dimension. The concept is similar, but the application was seen as a ``Metamodel'' to summarize the results of an experimental design. Our goal instead is to improve optimization convergence under noisy measurements.
